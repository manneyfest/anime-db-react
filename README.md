Anime Database (Anime DB) React Application
This repository contains the source code for the Anime Database (Anime DB) application, a frontend capstone project developed using React. The application allows users to search for anime/movies and view detailed information about them, leveraging a public movie API.

Project Overview
As a frontend developer, this project focuses on designing and implementing a dynamic movie database. It serves as a practical exercise for integrating external APIs, handling user input, managing application state, and creating a responsive user interface. This project simulates a real-world development environment, providing valuable experience in frontend web development and deployment.

Functional Requirements
1. Fetch Movie Data
Utilize a public movie API (e.g., OMDB API) to retrieve movie data based on user search queries.

Display a list of matching movies, showing:

Movie Poster (thumbnail image)

Title

Release Date (year)

2. Movie Details View
Upon clicking a movie from the list, present a detailed view with:

Plot Summary

Cast (main actors and roles)

Ratings (from various sources like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes)

Genre Categories

3. Search Functionality
Implement a search bar for users to input movie names and receive relevant results.

Provide a user-friendly message when no movies match the search query.

4. Responsive UI Design
Design a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

Ensure easy navigation within the movie list and details view on all devices.

5. Error Handling
Implement robust error handling for common scenarios (network issues, invalid API responses, no results).

Display clear and informative error messages to the user.

Technical Requirements
1. Project Setup
React project set up using Vite.

Tailwind CSS configured for styling (optional, but planned for responsive design).

2. API Integration
Utilize an API key from OMDB or a similar movie service.

Asynchronously fetch data using fetch or axios.

Present fetched data in a structured and visually appealing format.

3. User Interface Components
Develop reusable React components such as SearchBar, MovieCard, and MovieDetails.

Design a cohesive visual layout adhering to consistency in colors, typography, and spacing.

4. State Management
Employ React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for managing data fetching, user input, and UI updates.

Consider exploring advanced state management solutions (Zustand, Redux, etc.) for complex scenarios.

5. Deployment
Deploy the completed application on a free hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

Ensure the deployed application is accessible and performs well.

Getting Started (Local Development)
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/manneyfest/anime-db-react.git
cd anime-db-react


Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

The application will typically be available at http://localhost:5173/.

Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)
Favorites List: Allow users to save movies to a local storage-backed favorites list.

Pagination: Implement pagination for search results to navigate large datasets.

Sorting and Filtering: Add options to sort (e.g., by release date, ratings) and filter (e.g., by genre, year) search results.

Movie Trailers: Embed YouTube or other video trailers in the movie details view.

Theme Customization: Introduce light/dark mode functionality.

Internationalization: Add support for multiple languages.
